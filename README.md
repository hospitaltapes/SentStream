# SentStream
Streams incoming tweets off twitter to a SQL database with sentiment analysis, follower counts, and more. Also prints the output into your console. 

# How to run:
Before running, add your Twitter Dev keys into the designated slots in the sentstream.py file. Save.

Run SentStream.py - When prompted, name the database you are creating and the keyword you wish to search. To check functionality, point it at a frequently used keyword (BTS, Donald Trump, Justin Bieber, etc...). All output will stream to console as well as your newly created db.
