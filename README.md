# SentStream
Streams incoming tweets off twitter to an SQL database with sentiment analysis, follower counts, and more. Also prints the output into your console. 

# How to run:
run SentStream.py and when prompted, name the database you are creating and the keyword you wish to search. To check functionality, point it at a frequently used keyword like BTS or Donald Trump. All output will stream to console as well as your newly created db.
